Articles Ranker - JS Coding test

1. I recommend using Firefox because it does not block AJAX locally
2. To see the submited rank, i recommend using Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc for linux (.csv file)
For bigger screen resolutions i would change the css file: 
#paddingArticle{
	padding: 1% 25%;
}
